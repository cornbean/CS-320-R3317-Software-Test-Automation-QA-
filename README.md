1.  How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way I can ensure my code is functional and secure is making sure the source code is encrypted. If the source code is encrypted and protected, then bad actors can't somehow change the code and make either the program not work, or worse make it malicious. Another way is make sure any transfer of files or code is over a secured network, such as a vpn, so no hackers can intercept the data.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

One of the best ways to interpret user needs and incorpate them into a program is by asking the user what their main goal with the program is, and go from there. Once you have a clear understanding of their goals, then it is easier to create a game plan and figure out which way the program should go. 

3. How do I approach designing software?

The way I approach designing software is creating clear goals from the start of what the program needs to accomplish, and set my roadmap from there. Having a clear structure will make it easier to see the bigger picture and not get bogged down too much in the details just yet at the start of development. When you have all the big pieces in place, it will be easier to add on the finer details piece by piece, and making sure to do ample tests along the way to make sure everything is progressing smoothly and efficiently.
